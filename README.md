# onegate-donation
OneGate is a website that allows the user to donate for any charitable cause/items like food, blood, and environment and for animals. This will save the users’ time and energy because the user would not have to go to multiple websites. 
Users can donate various categories of things by clicking the images. They are then navigated to a subpage that contains all donation websites on which they can donate. When they click on the charity they want to donate to they get full information, payment procedure, reputation etc. on the charity’s website. OneGate won WORLDCODINGBEE Season 1 in 2020-2021 for it’s out of box idea and easy to use UI and UX.
